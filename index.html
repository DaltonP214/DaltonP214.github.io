                    Our users are frustrated with forgetting about food in their fridge. They go out and buy hundreds of dollars worth of food and by the time they get around to it, it could be spoiled!

                    My group and I, having decided what our idea was. Started to think about the things we needed to 
                    do for our problem. We though about what our product could do, Who its target audience was, how we could make
                    a profit from it and how we would compete v/s apps that are like ours.
